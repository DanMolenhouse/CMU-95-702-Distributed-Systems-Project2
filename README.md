# CMU-95-702-Distributed-Systems-Project2
Project 2 for CMU course 95-702 (Distributed Systems)Spring 2022

Project Objective:
1. Understand client side and server side UDP and TCP sockets.
2. Simulate a man-in-the-middle attack and understand the indicators and implications of this type of attack.
3. Understand TCP and UDP protocols through first-hand experience.
4. Familiarize with the abstraction provided by Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) and implement digital signatures in RSA. 

Tasks: 

0. Modify Server & Client code from in-class Lab to print certain messages and respond to given commands.
1. Simulate a man-in-the-middle attack
2. Create a simple addition method on the server that is called by the client, server responds with a running total. Server keeps track of total as long as it's running (client can exit / return and see the same total).
3. Same principle as Task 2, but adds a method for basic subtraction.
4. Repeat Task 3 using TCP instead of UDP.
5. Implement RSA & digitally sign messages (modeled after ETH signatures).
